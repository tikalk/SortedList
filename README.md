# Sorted List

Sample application to demonstrate using a [SortedList](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/util/SortedList.html) in a [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html).

The application is a single activity that populates a catalogue list of 100 products sorted by descending rank.

Two product flavors exist: "fake" to use fake randomly generated data; and "live" which connects anonymously to a Google Firebase database to sync with its live data.
